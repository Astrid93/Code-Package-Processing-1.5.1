GENERATIVEDESIGN CODE PACKAGE 1.0.1 - 13 November 2009

Bug fixes:

M_2_6_01_TOOL_TABLET: Import of the wrong library. Due to some
strange conflicts of the function selectInput() and the bang
button in controlP5 for loading an image (probably event handling 
order) the bang button was removed. Loading of the image can now
be done with the key 'o'.
